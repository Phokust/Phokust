- Hi there, I'm Brandon Claymore Santoso.

- I'm a Senior Electrical Engineering Student at the University of Washington. I concentrated in Embedded Systems, and have experience in VLSI/IC and Mixed-Signal Design. 

- I work with primarily Unix-based OS, virtuoso, python, and java.

- I'm interested in learning more about front/back-end web development.
